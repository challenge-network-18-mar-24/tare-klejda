                    <h4>
                        <p>The world of art has always fascinated and involved me since I was a child. I lived my first years of life in Greece, in
                            Athens, surrounded by art and mythology. I think it is one of the reasons why I have always loved art, or also because
                            since I was a child I observed my father drawing mythological figures, modeling bronze creating vases with a Mycenaean
                            essence or carving wood; I was fascinated because he could create something wonderful with any type of material. <br>
                            He certainly managed to convey to me his passion for art and mythology, taking me to visit the places that covered ancient
                            Greek history. So, I immediately had clear ideas about the type of education I would pursue, in fact I enrolled in art
                            high school and started practicing different types of art including: sculpture, painting, silk-screen printing, etc. <br>
                            I subsequently continued studying Fashion Design, because I felt I wanted to combine my passion for fashion with art.
                            During my university years, I decided to interface with the world of new art technologies, because I wanted to enhance
                            my knowledge in that field. During my three-year degree I created graphics and digital illustrations through Illustrator
                            and InDesign, I laid out books and created covers, flyers and brand identity, I created videos using Premiere and After
                            effect and I also studied Web design.</p>
                        
                            <p>After graduating with excellent results, I found the announcement on Linkedin of the start of an Academy as a Graphic Developer at the Delta
                                System company and I decided to undertake this path as it seemed inherent to my studies. After being selected for the
                                internship, I was responsible for the creation of interior and exterior design catalogs (created by inserting formulas
                                using the VBnet programming language) and for the translation of old rules making them compatible with MIO, their
                                application designed to configure the mobile in 3D, which exploits the use of augmented reality and virtual reality.
                                Since the world was not very creative, because it was mainly about programming, I decided to look for a job role in a
                                more artistic and creative field related to my studies.</p>
