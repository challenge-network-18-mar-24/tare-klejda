    <h3>Presentation</h3>

    <p>The world of art has always fascinated and involved me since I was a child. I lived my first years of life in Greece, in
    Athens, surrounded by art and mythology. I think it is one of the reasons why I have always loved art, or also because
    since I was a child I observed my father drawing mythological figures, modeling bronze creating vases with a Mycenaean
    essence or carving wood; I was fascinated because he could create something wonderful with any type of material. He
    certainly managed to convey to me his passion for art and mythology, taking me to visit the places that covered ancient
    Greek history. So, I immediately had clear ideas about the type of education I would pursue, in fact I enrolled in art
    high school and started practicing different types of art including: sculpture, painting, silk-screen printing, etc.
    I subsequently continued studying Fashion Design, because I felt I wanted to combine my passion for fashion with art.
    During my university years, I decided to interface with the world of new art technologies, because I wanted to enhance
    my knowledge in that field. During my three-year degree I created graphics and digital illustrations through Illustrator
    and InDesign, I laid out books and created covers, flyers and brand identity, I created videos using Premiere and After
    effect and I also studied Web design.</p>

    <p>After graduating with excellent results, I found the announcement on Linkedin of the start of an Academy as a Graphic Developer at the Delta
        System company and I decided to undertake this path as it seemed inherent to my studies. After being selected for the
        internship, I was responsible for the creation of interior and exterior design catalogs (created by inserting formulas
        using the VBnet programming language) and for the translation of old rules making them compatible with MIO, their
        application designed to configure the mobile in 3D, which exploits the use of augmented reality and virtual reality.
        Since the world was not very creative, because it was mainly about programming, I decided to look for a job role in a
        more artistic and creative field related to my studies.</p>
